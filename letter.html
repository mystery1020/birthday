        <p><i>People say <b>"the deeper we love, the harder it is to describe it"</b> which i would say is the case for me. We have been so used to each other now or i would say that i have been so used to you now that i cannot (and don't want to) imagine a life without you P.
         Okay, first of all A VERY VERY VERY HAPPYY BIRTHDAY TO THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW!
        I want you to achieve everything in life that you ever truly desire, i do want to see you at the top. If we talk about Sakshi, she will always want what Piyush wants, she would always want this only man in her life to be as happy as any human could ever be or
    could not be idc. We may 'kalesh' alot but in the end, its you. It is you that my heart wants to come to at the end of the day, to brag
(also about you). You are the only person that knows me inside out. You have always been there for me and P, trust me, i do not want anything
more than you to be happy and all glowy. I just love your presence. I love when you talk to me, I love it when we are together. I don't know WHY
but my heart is so so so connected to you that it cannot bear distance now, I cannot go away. I have made you my friend(s), my bestfriend,
my all time gossip partner, my all time crime partner, basically everything. Personally, I don't feel need of people when YOOU are here 
with me. I don't feel as connected to anyone as much as i do to you. You can test me. My heart will always long for you, it will always need YOU and 
only YOU. I want to be there for you in every thick and thins. I want to help you heal, heal from everything you do not talk about 
but i know there are alot of wounds you carry! Just know that I am always here.
